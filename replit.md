### System Architecture
HuntProductHunt is built with Node.js (CommonJS) and uses the Express.js framework. It runs on port 5000 and is hosted on 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility. The UI/UX is inspired by ProductHunt's aesthetic, featuring a signature orange branding, glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and modern UI components.

**Key Features:**
*   **Hunt Weather & Command Center (Integrated):** Unified dashboard combining Hunt Weather scoring system with real-time Command Center features. Hunt Weather provides weighted hunt score (0-100) based on category hotness, optimal hunt day/time alignment, and competition level, plus real-time hunt timers (user time, PST time, today's hunt countdown, next hunt countdown), and category analytics (Top Categories by Product Count and Average Upvotes by Category charts). Command Center adds live leaderboard of top 20 products (with ProductHunt link) showing velocity indicators (ðŸ”¥HOT >30 upvotes/hr, ðŸ“ˆRising 15-30/hr, ðŸ“‰Slow <15/hr), optimal engagement timing windows (6-9AM, 12-2PM, 5-7PM PST), and contextual action suggestions. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.
*   **Get Your Product Ready to Hunt:** Comprehensive launch preparation section featuring AI-powered hunt analysis (using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini for personalized insights), professional hunt asset generation (5 assets including optimized tagline, description, first comment, social post, and launch tips), one-click social templates (Twitter/LinkedIn/Email with copy-to-clipboard), and competitor analysis showing top 5 products with catchability gaps (ðŸŸ¢â‰¤50 upvotes=Catchable / ðŸ”´>50=Monitor).
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** All analytics are now integrated into Hunt Weather & Command Center for a streamlined experience. No separate product cards - all product information is accessible via the clickable leaderboard.
*   **Feedback System:** Lightweight footer with feedback modal allowing users to send email feedback (cosmorudyrp@gmail.com), share on Twitter, or visit ProductHunt. No backend infrastructure required - uses mailto links and social sharing URLs.

**Technical Implementations:**
*   **Hunt Score Algorithm:** A weighted algorithm considering Category Hotness (35%), Best Day Alignment (25%), Best Time Alignment (20%), and Competition Level (20%).
*   **AI-Powered Hunt Analysis:** POST /api/analyze-hunt endpoint using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (temp: 0.7, max_tokens: 1500) with structured JSON output. Analyzes product details against ProductHunt data to generate personalized hunt scores and actionable insights.
*   **AI-Powered Asset Generation:** POST /api/generate-assets endpoint using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (temp: 0.8, max_tokens: 2000) with structured JSON output. Generates 5 professional hunt assets based on proven patterns from top ProductHunt launches and Golden Kitty winners.
*   **Real-Time Hunt Timers:** Four synchronized clocks displaying user local time, PST time (ProductHunt timezone), countdown to today's hunt end (11:59 PM PST), and countdown to next hunt start (12:01 AM PST tomorrow). Updates every second.
*   **Auto-Refresh Hunt Weather:** Hunt Weather score and recommendations automatically recalculate every 60 seconds to provide up-to-date insights as time progresses and optimal hunt windows change.
*   **Data Handling:** Requires a minimum of 3 products for predictions, with confidence levels for data sufficiency. All calculations use real ProductHunt data and are performed client-side. AI features send recent ProductHunt data as context for more accurate recommendations.
