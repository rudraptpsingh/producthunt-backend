# HuntProductHunt

### Overview
HuntProductHunt is an AI-powered analytics platform designed to maximize ProductHunt success for Makers. It offers real-time insights, trend visualization, an AI-powered Hunt Weather system, and professional hunt asset generation. The platform uses authentic ProductHunt terminology (Hunt, Maker, Hunting) throughout to feel native to the PH community and help users predict, optimize, and win their ProductHunt hunts through data-driven recommendations and asset creation.

### Recent Changes
*   **October 28, 2025:** Complete UI redesign to match ProductHunt's aesthetic - white backgrounds (#FFFFFF), signature orange (#DA552F), clean borders, minimal shadows. Rebranded from "Launch" to "Hunt" terminology throughout. Updated hero with "Analyze. Hunt. Win." tagline and award badges. Optimized for mobile with responsive design (typography, spacing, touch-friendly buttons). **Added Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** tracking to match top ProductHunt winners' analytics stack - tracks feature views, dashboard loads, hunt analysis, and asset generation with event-based monitoring. **Implemented auto-refresh for Hunt Weather** - score and recommendations now update every 60 seconds to reflect real-time changes in optimal hunt timing. **Added lightweight feedback system** - footer with feedback modal offering email contact, Twitter sharing, and ProductHunt link (no backend required). **Integrated OpenAI API** for AI-powered hunt analysis and asset generation using gpt-4o-mini for cost optimization - both features now use real AI instead of template-based logic, providing personalized insights based on ProductHunt best practices and successful launch patterns. **Renamed product from "ProductHunter" to "HuntProductHunt"** - updated branding everywhere including logo, page title, feedback forms, analytics documentation, and project documentation to reflect the new name. **Integrated Hunt Weather & Command Center** - unified dashboard combining Hunt Weather (score, timers, recommendations) with Command Center features (live leaderboard with clickable ProductHunt links and velocity indicators 🔥HOT/📈Rising/📉Slow, optimal engagement windows 6-9AM/12-2PM/5-7PM PST, and action suggestions). **Created Track My Hunt section** - new dedicated section where users can input their ProductHunt URL to receive real-time tracking with product summary (rank, upvotes, comments, velocity), personalized social templates (Twitter/LinkedIn/Email), and competitor analysis showing catchability gaps relative to the tracked product. Removed redundant product cards grid. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. **Fixed Track My Hunt API bugs** - (1) removed `order: VOTES` parameter from GraphQL query so the endpoint now correctly fetches today's featured products instead of all-time top products, enabling accurate URL matching for products hunted today; (2) updated URL parser to accept both `/posts/` and `/products/` URL formats for maximum compatibility with ProductHunt links.
*   **October 29, 2025:** **Implemented expandable leaderboard product details** - Click any leaderboard row to expand and reveal detailed Performance Metrics (6 key metrics: upvotes, comments, velocity, engagement rate, hours live, rank) and Quick Analysis. Smooth expand/collapse animation with visual indicator (▶/▼). **Redesigned Quick Analysis with visual badge system** - Transformed text paragraphs into scannable color-coded badges: Gold gradient for Top 3, Orange for Top 10, Purple for Hot momentum, Pink for Rising, Green for High engagement, Blue for Moderate, and Gray for neutral states. Reduced clutter and improved scannability at a glance. Removed redundant Links section since ProductHunt link is already in product name. Mobile-optimized with single-column grid and smaller badge sizing.

### User Preferences
*   Use ProductHunt-specific terminology: "Hunt" (not "Launch"), "Maker" (product creator), "Hunter" (discovers products), "Hunting" (discovering/upvoting)

### System Architecture
HuntProductHunt is built with Node.js (CommonJS) and uses the Express.js framework. It runs on port 5000 and is hosted on 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility. The UI/UX is inspired by ProductHunt's aesthetic, featuring a signature orange branding, glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and modern UI components.

**Key Features:**

Hunt Weather provides weighted hunt score (0-100) based on category hotness, optimal hunt day/time alignment, and competition level, plus real-time hunt timers (user time, PST time, today's hunt countdown, next hunt countdown), and category analytics (Top Categories by Product Count and Average Upvotes by Category charts). Command Center adds live leaderboard of top 20 products (with clickable ProductHunt links) showing velocity indicators (🔥HOT >30 upvotes/hr, 📈Rising 15-30/hr, 📉Slow <15/hr), optimal engagement timing windows (6-9AM, 12-2PM, 5-7PM PST), and contextual action suggestions. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.
*   **Track My Hunt:** Real-time product tracking section where users can input their ProductHunt URL to receive personalized insights. Features include: (1) Product Summary showing rank, upvotes, comments, category, and velocity; (2) One-click social templates (Twitter/LinkedIn/Email) customized for the tracked product with copy-to-clipboard functionality; (3) Competitor Analysis showing products above and below the tracked product with catchability gaps (🟢≤50 upvotes=Catchable / 🎯>50=Keep pushing / ✅Leading). All data fetched live from ProductHunt API.
*   **Get Your Product Ready to Hunt:** Comprehensive launch preparation section featuring AI-powered hunt analysis (using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini for personalized insights) and professional hunt asset generation (5 assets including optimized tagline, description, first comment, social post, and launch tips).
*   **Feedback System:** Lightweight footer with feedback modal allowing users to send email feedback (cosmorudyrp@gmail.com), share on Twitter, or visit ProductHunt. No backend infrastructure required - uses mailto links and social sharing URLs.

*   **AI-Powered Hunt Analysis:** POST /api/analyze-hunt endpoint using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (temp: 0.7, max_tokens: 1500) with structured JSON output. Analyzes product details against ProductHunt data to generate personalized hunt scores and actionable insights.
*   **AI-Powered Asset Generation:** POST /api/generate-assets endpoint using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini (temp: 0.8, max_tokens: 2000) with structured JSON output. Generates 5 professional hunt assets based on proven patterns from top ProductHunt launches and Golden Kitty winners.
*   **Track My Hunt:** POST /api/track-hunt endpoint that parses ProductHunt URLs, extracts product slug, fetches live product data from ProductHunt API, calculates velocity (upvotes/hour), identifies competitor products within ±3 ranks, and returns comprehensive tracking data for personalized insights and templates.
*   **Real-Time Hunt Timers:** Four synchronized clocks displaying user local time, PST time (ProductHunt timezone), countdown to today's hunt end (11:59 PM PST), and countdown to next hunt start (12:01 AM PST tomorrow). Updates every second.
*   **Auto-Refresh Hunt Weather:** Hunt Weather score and recommendations automatically recalculate every 60 seconds to provide up-to-date insights as time progresses and optimal hunt windows change.
