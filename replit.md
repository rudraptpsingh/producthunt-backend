## Algorithm Details

### Launch Score Calculation (Predictor)
The predictor uses a weighted scoring algorithm:

1. **Category Hotness (35%)**
   - Analyzes products from last 14 days
   - Combines recency ratio (40%) + performance score (60%)
   - Higher scores for trending categories with strong recent performance

2. **Best Day Analysis (25%)**
   - Aggregates upvotes by day of week
   - Identifies days with highest average performance
   - Provides percentage-based impact estimates

3. **Best Time Analysis (20%)**
   - Groups launches by hour of day
   - Finds peak engagement windows
   - Displays optimal launch time in PST

4. **Competition Level (20%)**
   - Compares average vs top quartile performance
   - Low competition (70%+ ratio): Great opportunity
   - Medium competition (40-70% ratio): Moderate difficulty
   - High competition (<40% ratio): Very competitive

### Personalized Launch Analysis (Analyzer)
User-specific weighted scoring algorithm:

1. **Tagline Length (25%)**
   - Calculates optimal length from top 5 performers
   - Scores based on proximity to optimal (¬±20% is optimal)
   - Provides specific guidance (add detail vs. be concise)

2. **Category Performance (30%)**
   - Analyzes average upvotes in selected category
   - Benchmarks against all categories
   - Identifies hot categories (70%+), moderate (40-70%), competitive (<40%)

3. **Launch Day Alignment (25%)**
   - Compares user's choice to best performing day
   - Shows percentage difference from optimal
   - No penalty if day not specified (defaults to 75 score)

4. **Launch Time Alignment (20%)**
   - Compares planned time to peak engagement hour
   - Identifies optimal launch windows
   - No penalty if time not specified (defaults to 75 score)
