# HuntProductHunt

### Overview
HuntProductHunt is an AI-powered analytics platform designed to maximize ProductHunt success for Makers. It offers real-time insights, trend visualization, an AI-powered Hunt Weather system, and professional hunt asset generation. The platform uses authentic ProductHunt terminology (Hunt, Maker, Hunting) throughout to feel native to the PH community and help users predict, optimize, and win their ProductHunt hunts through data-driven recommendations and asset creation.

### Recent Changes
*   **October 28, 2025:** Complete UI redesign to match ProductHunt's aesthetic - white backgrounds (#FFFFFF), signature orange (#DA552F), clean borders, minimal shadows. Rebranded from "Launch" to "Hunt" terminology throughout. Updated hero with "Analyze. Hunt. Win." tagline and award badges. Optimized for mobile with responsive design (typography, spacing, touch-friendly buttons). **Added Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** tracking to match top ProductHunt winners' analytics stack - tracks feature views, dashboard loads, hunt analysis, and asset generation with event-based monitoring. **Implemented auto-refresh for Hunt Weather** - score and recommendations now update every 60 seconds to reflect real-time changes in optimal hunt timing. **Added lightweight feedback system** - footer with feedback modal offering email contact, Twitter sharing, and ProductHunt link (no backend required). **Integrated OpenAI API** for AI-powered hunt analysis and asset generation using gpt-4o-mini for cost optimization - both features now use real AI instead of template-based logic, providing personalized insights based on ProductHunt best practices and successful launch patterns. **Renamed product from "ProductHunter" to "HuntProductHunt"** - updated branding everywhere including logo, page title, feedback forms, analytics documentation, and project documentation to reflect the new name. **Integrated Hunt Weather & Command Center** - unified dashboard combining Hunt Weather (score, timers, recommendations) with Command Center features (live leaderboard with clickable ProductHunt links and velocity indicators ðŸ”¥HOT/ðŸ“ˆRising/ðŸ“‰Slow, optimal engagement windows 6-9AM/12-2PM/5-7PM PST, and action suggestions). **Created Track My Hunt section** - new dedicated section where users can input their ProductHunt URL to receive real-time tracking with product summary (rank, upvotes, comments, velocity), personalized social templates (Twitter/LinkedIn/Email), and competitor analysis showing catchability gaps relative to the tracked product. Removed redundant product cards grid. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds. **Fixed Track My Hunt API bug** - removed `order: VOTES` parameter from GraphQL query so the endpoint now correctly fetches today's featured products instead of all-time top products, enabling accurate URL matching for products hunted today.

### User Preferences
*   Use ProductHunt-specific terminology: "Hunt" (not "Launch"), "Maker" (product creator), "Hunter" (discovers products), "Hunting" (discovering/upvoting)

### System Architecture
HuntProductHunt is built with Node.js (CommonJS) and uses the Express.js framework. It runs on port 5000 and is hosted on 0.0.0.0 for Replit compatibility. The UI/UX is inspired by ProductHunt's aesthetic, featuring a signature orange branding, glassmorphism effects, gradient backgrounds, and modern UI components.

Command Center adds live leaderboard of top 20 products (with clickable ProductHunt links) showing velocity indicators (ðŸ”¥HOT >30 upvotes/hr, ðŸ“ˆRising 15-30/hr, ðŸ“‰Slow <15/hr), optimal engagement timing windows (6-9AM, 12-2PM, 5-7PM PST), and contextual action suggestions. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

Features include: (1) Product Summary showing rank, upvotes, comments, category, and velocity; (2) One-click social templates (Twitter/LinkedIn/Email) customized for the tracked product with copy-to-clipboard functionality; (3) Competitor Analysis showing products above and below the tracked product with catchability gaps (ðŸŸ¢â‰¤50 upvotes=Catchable / ðŸŽ¯>50=Keep pushing / âœ…Leading). All data fetched live from ProductHunt API.
