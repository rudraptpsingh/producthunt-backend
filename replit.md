## Algorithm Details

### Launch Score Calculation
The predictor uses a weighted scoring algorithm:

1. **Category Hotness (35%)**
   - Analyzes products from last 14 days
   - Combines recency ratio (40%) + performance score (60%)
   - Higher scores for trending categories with strong recent performance

2. **Best Day Analysis (25%)**
   - Aggregates upvotes by day of week
   - Identifies days with highest average performance
   - Provides percentage-based impact estimates

3. **Best Time Analysis (20%)**
   - Groups launches by hour of day
   - Finds peak engagement windows
   - Displays optimal launch time in PST

4. **Competition Level (20%)**
   - Compares average vs top quartile performance
   - Low competition (70%+ ratio): Great opportunity
   - Medium competition (40-70% ratio): Moderate difficulty
   - High competition (<40% ratio): Very competitive

### Data Handling
- Minimum 3 products required for predictions
- Confidence levels: High (10+ products), Medium (5-9), Low (<5)
- Graceful fallbacks for insufficient data
- Respects user filters for targeted analysis
